# Challenges
Challenges are designed to be similar to a customer's scenario.  The material should be reviewed by a team, the requirements extracted, and then implemented in the environment. In many cases the scenario can be solved in multiple ways and so discussion of "this approach" vs. "that approach" is helpful.
