# Challenges
Challenges are designed to be similar to a customer's scenario.  The material should be reviewed by a team, the requirements extracted, and then implemented in the environment. In many cases the scenario can be solved in multiple ways and so discussion of "this approach" vs. "that approach" is helpful.

## Thoughts for MWA Challenges
1. **Challenge 3** - includes some compliance policy application via Azure Security Center.  This may not be useful to the MWAs, but a similar scenario that uses Compliance Center in M365 could be substituted here. Also, this is where Sentinel is set up and while that would be great, the subscriptions may be an issue.
1. **Challenge 6** - Remove as this challenge is only focused on Azure solutions
1. **Challenge 7** - Remove Sentinel integration/component
1. **Challenge 9** - Remove the Sentinel integration
