# Challenges
Challenges are designed to be similar to a customer's scenario.  The material should be reviewed by a team, the requirements extracted, and then implemented in the environment. In many cases the scenario can be solved in multiple ways and so discussion of "this approach" vs. "that approach" is helpful.

## Thoughts for MWA Challenges
1. **Challenge 3** - includes some compliance policy application via Azure Security Center.  This may not be useful to the MWAs, but a similar scenario that uses Compliance Center in M365 could be substituted here.
1. **Challenge 6** - is around Azure Policies (VM Size, Region, etc.) and may not be highly applicable to MWAs, but for those that are interested in a challenge this could be really fun
