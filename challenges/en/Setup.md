# Set Up Your Challenge Environment
You can stand up your own environment to run thought the various challenges. This series of challenges can be done in a short or long period of time, with some exceptions, so using a 90-day or 1-year tenant is possible.

## Request a Demo Environment
1. Go to [CDX OnRamp/Microsoft Demo Site](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com)
1. Select the [My Tenants](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/my-tenants) option from the top menu
1. Click the [Create Tenant](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/my-tenants/create-tenant) button
    1. At the top of the screen you can choose either the 90-day or 1-year tenant option.
1. Find the **Microsoft 365 Enterprise Demo Content** option and click the *Create Tenant* button
    1. Accept the Terms of Use and continue
    1. The tenant will be provisioned with a default admin account as well as numerous users and content.  For the purposes of these challenges these are the only identities and accounts you will need.

## Make access to your tenant easier
1. Create a Profile in your Edge browser for your Admin account so you can easily save passwords, bookmarks, and generally get into the environment more quickly and easily.
2. Create a Second Profile in your Edge browser for the Megan Bowen account
